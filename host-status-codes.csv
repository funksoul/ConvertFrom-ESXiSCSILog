"Code","Description"
"0x00","NO error"
"0x01","Couldn't connect before timeout period"
"0x02","BUS stayed busy through time out period"
"0x03","TIMED OUT for other reason (often this an unexpected device selection timeout)"
"0x04","BAD target, device not responding?"
"0x05","Told to abort for some other reason."
"0x06","Parity error. Older SCSI parallel buses have a parity bit for error detection. This probably indicates a cable or termination problem."
"0x07","Internal error detected in the host adapter."
"0x08","The SCSI bus (or this device) has been reset. Any SCSI device on a SCSI bus is capable of instigating a reset."
"0x09","Got an interrupt we weren't expecting"
"0x0a","Force command past mid-layer"
"0x0b","The low level driver wants a retry"
"0x0c","A transient error. When this status is returned, the I/O command is requeued and issued again."
"0x0d","the HBA driver tries to abort a command which then sets the IOSTAT_LOCAL_REJECT status on all commands in the iocb ring. This causes the original command to requeue."
